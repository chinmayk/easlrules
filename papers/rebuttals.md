# Responding to rebuttals

* *On the day you receive your reviews* (and no later), summarize the reviews in a google doc.
* *Then, in a timely fashion...* Regardless of score, take all the easy changes and make them.
* Add thorny changes as comments in a google doc. Your doc should be a repository for all reviewer comments. Group by concern. e.g. "Concern 1 (R1, R2):  what it is;  proposed actions to resolve if any". As you make changes, mark them as resolved in the document
* If your 1AC score is 2.5 or higher, draft a rebuttal. A rebuttal does not to be exhaustive. And it doesn’t need to summarize all the nice things reviewers said. Focus on factual errors or factual questions in the reviews. If the reviewers say “you used the wrong test” and you disagree, say why.

Ask Chinmay for access to a repository of past reviews and rebuttals to see how to craft one well. Crafting a good rebuttal can make a difference, but it requires multiple drafts. 

## What goes into rebuttals
* Always start with a summary of the main challenges, **and the things that reviewers liked** about your paper. Reviewers are but human, if they see that your paper is valuable (albeit) flawed, you're more likely to persuade them it's worth publishing. So, always remind them what they liked in the first place. 
* Then, create a numbered list of high-level issues that reviewers identified, e.g. "Experimental protocol" is high-level, "how many of our participants were snowball sampled?" is not.
* For each high level point, mention each subpoint you fixed, changed, or want to clarify. *Summarize your changes*
* If they ask for specific numbers, include the edited text in the paper

## Rules of the game
Rebuttals are a specific genre of writing, and you need to follow the style to have the benefit of rebutting. Further, rebuttals are the authors' on-the-record opinions about their research. So, if I am a co-author: 
* Chinmay must see your rebuttal before you send it out (meeting is optional)
* Unless specified otherwise, changes suggested are not optional. You must fix them before you send it out.
