# Regularly scheduled meetings with Chinmay

## What the rules are trying to achieve

Scheduled meetings serve three goals:

* *Getting research/classes/etc advice*: This is the primary goal of the meeting, and most of the rules below aim to optimize our time so we can meet this goal. 
* *Research bookkeeping and rebalancing*: Occasionally, meetings can prod you to reflect on how you are spending your time, and if you are doing enough (the right kind of) research activity.
* *Reflect and improve on your process*: Meetings are too short for engaging in reflection during the meeting. However, preparing for the meeting should help you reflect and improve your process. 

## The rules
### Before/After meeting
1. Send me a pre-meeting email with your research update, and what you plan to discuss in the meeting around 24 hours before the meeting. 
1. Preferably immediately after your meeting, or in any case before the end of the day, please send me an email update with what we decided in the meeting. Be specific, but not verbose, in your email. e.g. "come up with measures for persistence, productivity, and social intimacy with group members after a group discussion", _not_ "Explore behavioral measurements for participants".
 
### What goes into a pre-meeting email
1. *The email is both an update and an agenda for your meeting*. So, use it to reflect on your week. Include what you've done during the week, and the decisions you've made (and why). 
    1. If it seems you've done too little, too much, or have done too many things during the week that distract from your research, I will add bookkeeping/rebalancing to our agenda. 
1. Your meeting agenda is a sketch, not a photograph: you can discuss things not on the agenda. I will too.
1. If your meeting agenda requires me to read anything, please send it at least 24 hours before the meeting. If you must discuss the topic and you haven't sent me the document in advance, I'll spend our meeting time reading, which isn't useful to either of us. 
1. Our research is very driven by theory and practice, and prototyping is what brings them together. e.g. if you've spent time looking at theories of institutionalized socialization, show me: prototypes that incorporate this theory, an experiment you've designed to test aspects of it, etc. 
1. Do pitch half-baked ideas (e.g. if you went to a talk and they said something interesting. You tried to make something based on it, but it didn't work/you're stuck -- let's chat). 
1. Don't only present a literature survey or review. (If that's all you've done this week, let's chat about how to work differently next time.)
1. Please leave me the last ten minutes of your hour slot so I can bring up topics not on your agenda.

### During the meeting

1. Be present. If you're using a computer, your research/work should be the only thing that is open. No pings from Slack, Wechat, and Facebook. No need to turn off your phone (emergencies happen), but please don't get distracted.
1. Take notes, in as few places as possible, preferably on paper. 
1. Do not make a slide-deck. 
1. I trust you, and that you've thought about your problem long and hard.
1. Be engaged. If you don't understand something, ask. If you disagree, speak up. I (sometimes?) propose bad ideas; make them better.
1. I will be critical. We have high standards in our lab, and if you work with us, I believe you can meet them.


### Asking for & using advice

1. Present data. Raw data where possible so we can eyeball it, or visualizations. (
    1. Wherever possible, bring a live console to the meeting. "The dashboard won't let me see it" = Use SQL, get data).
    2. Data can be minimal, but it can't be imaginary. e.g. if you think people hate Facebook's privacy options, show me data about how your friends are confused, or blog posts, or people posting questions online... "I think people hate it" is not data.  
2. If you want me to "green light" your solution, present alternative solutions that you considered, but think are inferior. 
3. Prototyping can be embarassing. I will tell you to ship before you think you're ready. Don't make excuses -- ship it.
4. No sunk-cost reasoning: if we realize that something will no longer yield value, we drop it, regardless of the time you've spent on it. 

## Other notes

* If my door is open and it's your meeting time, please come in even if someone's there.
