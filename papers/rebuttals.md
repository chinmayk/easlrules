# Do rebuttals help?
I've written maybe 8 years worth of rebuttals so far. Among these rebuttals,  I've only had one paper get accepted based on the rebuttal when reviewers have made up their mind to reject the paper. But usually, reviewers haven't made up their collective minds (even if there is a single strong voice among them). Often, there is genuine confusion and disagreement between your reviewers, and a rebuttal is very helpful. Also, a reviewer and on PCs, I find it much easier to make the case for acceptance if there is a well-reasoned rebuttal. 

If your 1AC score is 2 or lower or your average review score is 1.5 or lower (on a 5-point scale), you may choose to not draft a rebuttal. On the other hand, you may say "heck, they want to reject my paper, and I have nothing to lose" and draft a strong one :-) The practice might help the next paper you submit!

Ironically, rebuttals might help most when your paper is in the "accept" territory. It often forces reviewers to nudge scores higher (read: awards). 

# Responding to rebuttals
Rebuttals are a specific genre of writing, and following a specific style is more likely to yield the best benefits. Further, rebuttals are the authors' on-the-record opinions about their research. Ask Chinmay for access to a repository of past reviews and rebuttals if you have never written one to see how to craft one well. 

Crafting a good rebuttal can make a difference, but it requires multiple drafts. Here are some ways to maximise your benefits.

* *On the day you receive your reviews* (and no later), factually summarize the reviews in a google doc (what they say, regardless of whether it is true). This is a difficult time emotionally, but the rebuttal timeframe is usually so short that unless we get to this immediately, there is no time for the steps below.
* *Then, in a timely fashion...* Regardless of score, take all the easy changes the reviewers suggest and make them. Keep track of what you change. 
* Add thorny changes as comments in a google doc. Your doc should be a repository for all reviewer comments. Group by concern. e.g. "Concern 1 (R1, R2):  what it is;  proposed actions to resolve if any". As you make changes, mark them as resolved in the document. Remember all the easy changes you've made? Again, remember to document them. 
* A rebuttal does not to be exhaustive. And it doesn’t need to summarize all the nice things reviewers said. Focus on factual errors or factual questions in the reviews. If the reviewers say “you used the wrong test” and you disagree, say why.

## What goes into rebuttals
* Always start with a summary of the main challenges, **and the things that reviewers liked** about your paper. Reviewers are but human, if they see that your paper is valuable (albeit) flawed, you're more likely to persuade them it's worth publishing. So, always remind them what they liked in the first place. 
* Then, create a numbered list of issues that reviewers identified, and label them with the general area of concern; e.g. for "how many of our participants were snowball sampled?" or similar; write "Experimental protocol"
* For each high level concern, mention what you fixed, changed, or want to clarify. *Summarize your changes*
* If they ask for specific numbers, respond by quoting from your updated text in the paper. 

## Rules of the game
If I am a co-author: 
* I must see your rebuttal before you send it out. Because I might have a little more distance with the work, I can help you craft a message that the audience understands.
* Unless specified otherwise, you must fix issues we discover before you send it out. Otherwise, you're stealing cycles from your labmate who put in their best effort.
